### Hi there, I'm Aniqa 👋
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🔭 I’m currently working my way through the [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://github.com/aniqatc/100-days-of-code).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning in public: full stack software development & blogging my process along the way.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, hackathons, and interning opportunities.
- 💬 Ask me about anything and reach me by [email](mailto:hello@aniqa.io), [twitter](https://twitter.com/aniqatc), [polywork](https://updates.aniqa.io), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aniqaio/), or check out my other socials here: [aniqa.dev](https://aniqa.dev)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to work at an elected official's office for three years - the complete opposite of the tech world 😅
