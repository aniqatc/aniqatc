## Hi, I'm Aniqa 👩🏻‍💻
😄 A novice coder <br/>
🧰 Hoping to learn web development purely to build out my wildest ideas <br/>
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects and freelancing gigs <br/>
💻 Currently enrolled in a front-end web development bootcamp <br/>

🚨 All projects are still ongoing so there will be changes added on a regular basis until I'm satisfied enough to leave it alone. <br/>
📝 Working on writing reflection pieces for each one so stay tuned for a new and improved blog!
